            <h2>How do the Polaroid Land cameras work?</h2>
            <p> Polaroid Land cameras made instant photography possible with self-developing film that produced images in under a minute. A chemical pack spread developer across the photo as it ejected, revealing the image in real time. Just point, shoot, and wait for the magic to appear.</p>

            <h2>How to scan your exposures</h2>
            <p> Scanning instant film is the best way to preserve your favorite exposures before they fade. A flatbed scanner captures the image in high detail without damaging the original. It’s a simple step that turns a fragile photo into a lasting digital file. </p>
