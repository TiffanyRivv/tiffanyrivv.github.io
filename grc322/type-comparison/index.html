      <h1>Trade Gothic vs. Franklin Gothic </h1>
      <h2>History of each typeface</h2>
      <h3 class="Franklin">Franklin Gothic</h3>
      <!-- Older typeface first, please. -->
      <p> Franklin Gothic is a large family of sans-serif typefaces. The type was developed in the early 20th century by American Type Founders by the designer Morris Fuller Benton and its first version was released in 1902. Franklin Gothic is named after Benjamin Franklin as he was a prolific printer. In modern day Gothic refers to a time period in art but in type refers to the font being sans-serif. The design of the font draws from earlier nineteenth century models from the twenty-three foundries that were consolidated into American Type. Franklin Gothic is a versatile grotesque font that has been used in advertisements, news headlines, books, billboards, and more. Over the span of ten years the faces of Franklin Gothic were designed and issued by Benton and American Type. Digital font files for Franklin Gothic have been made by Adobe, International Typeface Corporation, Monotype Imaging, and URW and continue to be used to this day. </p>
      <h3 class="Trade">Trade Gothic</h3>
      <!-- Second typeface here. -->
      <p> Trade Gothic is a sans-serif typeface designed by Jackson Burke in 1948. He continued to design further style-weight combinations until 1960, 14 different combinations exist in total. Trade Gothic is the font used in notable logos such as John Deere and YouTube. Having been made in the early twentieth century, Trade Gothic is more irregular than many other sans-serif fonts that came earlier such as Univers and Helvetica. These irregularities make the typeface popular among designers who enjoy the character Trade Gothic has to offer. As we moved into the digital age digital font files were made for Trade Gothic. In February 2009 Trade Gothic Next was released by Linotype. This variation removed the inconsistencies from the original family and reworked the designs to include terminals, stroke endings, the spacing, and the kerning. </p>
